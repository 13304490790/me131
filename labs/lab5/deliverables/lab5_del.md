#### 1.1

The closed loop transfer function (reference > velocity):

$$
\frac{V}{R}=\frac{G_pG_c}{1+G_pG_c}\\
\frac{V}{R}=\frac{bk_{p}s + bk_{i}}{s^2+(bk_p-a)s + bk_i}
$$

#### 1.2

Gains to place the closed loop eigenvalues to achieve the natural frequency and damping ratio objective:
$$
k_p = 53,057\\
k_i = 32,400
$$

#### 1.3

The Simulink model for the closed loop longitudinal cruise control system:

On the vehicle:
$$
k_p = 70\\
k_i = 1
$$
The control parameters we calculated in Simulink because we employed a very simple first order model for our drivetrain in Simulink. It is unlikely that our battery, ESC, motor, and longitudinal vehicle dynamics for acceleration and braking and be accurately captured using a first order system. With a higher fidelity model for acceleration and braking, the gains calculated from simulation would more closely match the gains chosen on the vehicle.
