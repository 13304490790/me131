# ME131 Lab3 Deliverables

* Task 6.7 (ROS Architecture)
  * Draw a flow chart of the nodes, topics and messages associated with the BARC's IMU and actuators.
* Task 7.1 (rostopic pub)
  * Figure out what command you need to steer 30 degrees left at a comfortable forward velocity, describe what each component of the message refers to.
* Task 8.1 (rqt_plot of IMU for determining body axis)
  * Roughly sketch the BARC car, including the acceleration reference frame the BARC car uses, and the acceleration measurements when the car is standing still on the ground.
  * During your experiment, you will notice a large offset in the vertical acceleration measurement. What does this correspond to?
* Task 8.2 (Angular Velocity Measurements)
  * Do simple rotations tests and check that roll, pitch, and yaw measured by the gyros in the IMU are relative to the axes you found above. Label their directions on the same plot as your acceleration reference frame.
  * Do the signs follow the right hand rule?
